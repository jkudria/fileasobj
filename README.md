Public-able code, Python

This repo contains Python code I've written which is not covered by an NDA and is safe for publish. As with all code, though, use at your own risk.

FileAsObj.py - Manage a file as object, file contents stored in a list.

bark.py - Log or print given string, if unable to log, print.

npnlocker.py - Provide easy lock file management as a class

npnutils.py - Collection of requently used functions, although most have since been converted to proper classes.

pathic.py - Build keys, a hat size and borders. (also a great place for random.* examples)

subprocess-example.py - A complex example for using subprocess, born in reply to a r/learnpython post.

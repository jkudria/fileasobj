fileasobj.py
======
Manage a local file as an object. Store contents in a unique list and ignore commented lines.
Written to handle files that contain only text data, good for when you cannot or will not use a proper SQL database.

* Not useful for config files.
* Written by a SysAdmin who needed to treat files like databases.
